## Authentication Documentation
Medguard Systems provides credentialing and authentication products for
diagnostic providers.  This documentation outlines general technical
details for the Authentication API and the on-premise software
toolkit Medguard Agent.

## Authentication API
Our cloud identity provider (IdP) service exposes a set of endpoints
that Medguard Agent interacts with during an authentication event.

These endpoints can be found [here](www.google.com).

Please note that endpoints should not ordinarily be accessed directly
by providers.

## Medguard Agent
Our on-premise software is designed to be simple to configure, and
customised for individual use cases. The documentation presented here
represents a general use case. [Contact
us](https://www.medguard.io/#contact-us-section) to discuss how we can
customise Medguard Agent to fit your existing infrastructure
requirements.
